The folder contains the five models we used for the project to prediction duplicate question pairs. Each also contains a readme to run each individual model.

1. Bag of Words Naive Bayes
2. Bag of Words SVM
3. Bidirectional LSTM
4. Siamese LSTM
5. Decomposition Attention Model (Our Variation)

In addition, we also provided the code that we used to scrape Quora as well as our front end design
