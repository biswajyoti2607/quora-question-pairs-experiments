INSTRUCTIONS
------------

If you want to setup an instance from the github -
1) Copy build-paraphrase-id-tensorflow-master-from-github.sh to the instance
2) Run build-paraphrase-id-tensorflow-master-from-github.sh
3) When the script pauses, upload the train.csv and test.csv from kaggle to paraphrase-id-tensorflow-master/data/raw
4) When the model finishes running, the observe the output from nohup.output

If you want to setup an instance with a local version of the code, zip paraphrase-id-tensorflow-master as paraphrase-id-tensorflow-master.zip and upload paraphrase-id-tensorflow-master.zip along with build-paraphrase-id-tensorflow-master-from-local.sh and run as above.
